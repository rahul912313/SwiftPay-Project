# Payment Application

## Overview

This is a robust payment application built using modern web technologies. It currently leverages **React**, **Zod**, and the **MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)** stack. Future enhancements will include transitioning to **PostgreSQL** for database management and adopting a **monorepo** structure using **Turborepo** to optimize project management and build efficiency.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure sign-up and login system.
- **Payment Processing**: Easy and secure transaction handling.
- **Form Validation**: Ensured by **Zod** for type-safe and user-friendly form validation.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully functional across desktop and mobile devices.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Built with scalability in mind, ready for future extensions.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, Zod
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB (to be transitioned to **PostgreSQL**)
- **Others**: Turborepo for monorepo management (planned)

## Roadmap

- **Transition to PostgreSQL** for enhanced data management.
- **Monorepo structure** using Turborepo for improved scalability and modularity.
- **Integration of additional tech** for better performance and security.
